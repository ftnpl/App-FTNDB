FTN-Database

Fidonet/FTN Nodelist Database application, which can create or access an FTN
nodelist table in an SQL database for Fidonet/FTN nodelist processing.  The
SQL database engine is one for which a DBD module exists, defaulting to SQLite:

DBD::SQLite	SQLite DBD Module is required by default, so should be installed.
		Any other database engines will be named similarly and should be
		installed if used.  May	already be installed on your system;  if
		not, one place they may be obtained is at cpan (www.cpan.org).

Other required, neccessary and/or useful modules, etc.:

FTN::Log	Must be a least v0.02, for the 'logging' subroutine as used in 
		the nl2db and nldbadm scripts. If not already installed, one
		place it may be obtained is from the ftnpl project at Sourceforge.

Getopt::Std	May already be installed on your system;  if not, one place
		it may be obtained is at cpan (www.cpan.org).

The FTN-Database application is hosted at the 'Perl for FTN Systems' project
at SourceForge (ftnpl.sourceforge.net).  The ftnpl-user or ftnpl-develop mailing
lists are available from the project site; however, the FTN echos like PERL or
BBS_CARNIVAL can be used for discussions regarding it as well and are the
preferred avenues for support.
