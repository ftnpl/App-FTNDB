nl2sql v1.3

Perl scripts for using an SQL database for fidonet/FTN nodelist
processing.  This version uses only standard Perl and a database engine
for which a DBD module exists, defaulting to SQLite.

Note that the code history for the nl2sql scripts is now in the GIT branch of the same
name, available in the ftnpldb repository as follows:
git clone git://ftnpl.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/ftnpl/ftnpldb.git (Read Only)
http://ftnpl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=ftnpl/ftnpldb.git (Browse Online)

The ftnpl-user or ftnpl-develop mailing lists are available from the project site;
however, FTN echos like PERL or BBS_CARNIVAL can be used for discussions regarding
the nl2sql scripts as well and are the preferred avenues for support.
