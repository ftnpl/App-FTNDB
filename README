Perl scripts for using an SQL database for fidonet/FTN nodelist
processing.  This version uses only standard Perl, and SQLite as
the database engine.  Note that nl2db now has its own GIT
repository, available as follows:

git clone git://ftnpl.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/ftnpl/nl2db.git (Read Only)
http://ftnpl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=ftnpl/nl2db.git (Browse Online)

The ftnpl-user or ftnpl-develop mailing lists are available from the project site;
however, FTN echos like PERL or BBS_CARNIVAL can be used for discussions regarding
the nl2db scripts as well and are the preferred avenues for support.
