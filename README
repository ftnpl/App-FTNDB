Perl scripts for using an SQL database for fidonet/FTN nodelist
processing.  This version uses only standard Perl and a database engine
for which a DBD module exists, defaulting to SQLite.

net2file.pl     Perl script that lists a specified net from a specified zone of a 
		nodelist table containing information from a Fidonet/FTN St. Louis
		format nodelist to text file.

nl2db.pl        Perl script that loads an Fidonet/FTN nodelist into an sql database

nldbadm.pl      Perl script to create a nodelist table and other database
		administrative functions.


This is a listing of the Perl Modules which are required and/or can be used
with the nl2sql scripts.  Information about where they can be obtained is also
provided as neccessary.

FTN::Log	Must be a least v0.02, for the 'logging' subroutine as used by the
		scripts.  If not installed, it may be obtained from www.cpan.org,
		or from ftnpl.sourceforge.net or from a BBS carrying the PERLFDN
		file echo.

Getopt::Std	May already be installed on your system;  if not, one place
		it may be obtained is at cpan (www.cpan.org).

DBD::SQLite	Default database engine is SQLite, so this one should be installed.
		Any other database engines will be named similarly and should be
		installed if used.  May	already be installed on your system;  if
		not, one place they may be obtained is at cpan (www.cpan.org).


INSTALLATION

  Uncompress the archive, then change to that newly
created directory & do the following:

   1) perl Makefile.PL  
   2) make
   3) make test (optional)
   4) make install


SUPPORT

Note that the code history for the nl2sql scripts is now in the GIT branch of the same
name, available in the ftn-database repository as follows:
git clone git://ftnpl.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/ftnpl/ftn-database.git (Read Only)
http://ftnpl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=ftnpl/ftn-database.git (Browse Online)

The ftnpl-user or ftnpl-develop mailing lists are available from the project site;
however, FTN echos like PERL or BBS_CARNIVAL can be used for discussions regarding
the nl2sql scripts as well and are the preferred avenues for support.
