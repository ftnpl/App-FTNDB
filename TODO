To do:  nl2sql.pl    9/25/01

- rename nltst to nltst.sh, to allow for later versions such as nltst.cmd
  or nltsts.bat etc for use on OS's besides linux

- instead of having to give the full file name, add the capability of 
finding the most recent version (by day number) when given a base name

- add option to do the table index creation separately?

- add a check for a period in the area (table) name to be added;
mysql does not allow that because it is used for something else,
so it will need to be changed to an underscore and/or error'ed out.

- add logging capability

- add a test nodelist for use with this?...
