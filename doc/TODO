To Do:  v1.1   06/29/05


nl2sql.pl
----------
- When there are multiple nodelists of the same name being processed, the
script is using just one of them;  but not always the most recent one like
it should. (getnlfilename subroutine)

- get quoteing working properly for entry into the database for fields like
$loc & $name, so do not have to take out char's like single quotes, etc.

- add option to do the table index creation separately?


nltable.pl
-----------
- replace use of TableExists function with using sql code
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS <tablename>;

In General
-----------

- add quiet option, -q, for logging only operation ? 

- add a test nodelist for use with this?...

- the source field in the nodelist table is not enough?; add a new table,
nladm (?), that for nodelist files lists the filename with extension.
(& a timestamp?)
