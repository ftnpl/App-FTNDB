To Do:  v1.2   07/5/10

- Change to using the logging subroutine from FTN::Log directly instead of in the
'&logged' subroutine?  Using what is now the &logged subroutine is left over from
when the that subroutine actually had the logging code inline instead of being in
in a separate module like FTN::Log.  Besides anything else;  it's used alot & all 
of those subroutine calls may be taking a lot of unneccessary extra time.

- Add an option to define which type of database to use, defaulting to SQLite.  Can
use what's supported by the DBI DBD modules:  to start off with, use SQlite, mysql,
& postgresql.  Use "-D" for the option letter?

- Add command line parameters to define the database name ($dbname), user ($dbuser),
& password ( $dbpassord) for access to the database.  For SQLite, the db name would
be the name & path of the db file. If not set on the command line it is set to a default.
Use "-p" for the db password, "-u" for the db user, and "- ?" for the db name?

- The use of special charactors like periods in table names is a more general issue
where it is not a good idea to use them at all.  Redo the comments in both scripts
regarding that, to generalize it.

- Review all usage of subroutine calls, because I think I habitually
used the "&" calling convention, even though I don't think that 
the subroutines have any need for direct access to the parameters that
the script was called with ("@_"), and those parameters are put into
their own variables as neccessary in any cose.  Reference perldoc perlsub.

nl2db.pl
----------
- Add an option to load just a defined zone, instead of all zones that 
might be in the node list.  If defined zone is not in the nodelist, then
nothing ends up getting loaded.  Use "-z" for the option?

- Script does not seem to properly handle a file that ends in just blank
lines, instead of content line or a ^Z character.

- When there are multiple nodelists of the same name being processed, the
script is using just one of them;  but not always the most recent one like
it should. (getnlfilename subroutine)

- Get quoteing working properly for entry into the database for fields like
$loc & $name, so do not have to take out char's like single quotes, etc.

- Add option to do the table index creation separately?


nldbadm.pl
-----------

- Creating the ftnnode index had been being done as part of creating the
nodelist table.  Create a separate subroutine to do that.  That would
also allow adding being able to recreate the index if requested.

- Replace use of TableExists function with using sql code
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS <tablename>;

- Add better error checking.

In General
-----------

- Add quiet option, -q, for logging only operation ? 

- Add a test nodelist for use with this?...

- The source field in the nodelist table is not enough ?; add a new table,
nladm (?), that for nodelist files lists the filename with extension.
(& a timestamp?)
