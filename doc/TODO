To Do:  v1.2   07/16/10

- Add an option to define which type of database to use, defaulting to SQLite.  Can
use what's supported by the DBI DBD modules:  to start off with, use SQlite, mysql,
& postgresql.  Use "-D" for the option letter?

- The use of special charactors like periods in table names is a more general issue
where it is not a good idea to use them at all.  Redo the comments in both scripts
regarding that, to generalize it.

- Review all usage of subroutine calls, because I think I habitually
used the "&" calling convention, even though I don't think that 
the subroutines have any need for direct access to the parameters that
the script was called with ("@_"), and those parameters are put into
their own variables as neccessary in any cose.  Reference perldoc perlsub.

nl2db.pl
----------
- Script does not seem to properly handle a file that ends in just blank
lines, instead of content line or a ^Z character.

- When there are multiple nodelists of the same name being processed, the
script is using just one of them;  but not always the most recent one like
it should. (getnlfilename subroutine)

- Get quoteing working properly for entry into the database for fields like
$loc & $name, so do not have to take out char's like single quotes, etc.


nldbadm.pl
-----------

- Add options to create or drop the ftnnode index on the nodelist table.
- Add better error checking.

In General
-----------

- Add quiet option, -q, for logging only operation ? 

- Add a test nodelist for use with this?...

- The source field in the nodelist table is not enough ?; add a new table,
nladm (?), that for nodelist files lists the filename with extension.
(& a timestamp?)


For version 2.x
----------------
- Use modules for accessing the Nodelist files and the Nodelist database.
