To Do:  v1.3   08/13/10

- Update/rewrite/etc comments and documentation as necessary in all files.

- The option added to define which type of database to use does not currently do
any error checking on that type;  the script will fail if a correct DBD name
is not used.  If do not explicitly do such error or other checking, document the
standard names for DBI DBD modules like SQlite (default), mysql, cvs, & postgresql.  

- The use of special characters like periods in table names is a more general issue
where it is not a good idea to use them at all.  Redo the comments in both scripts
regarding that, to generalize it.

nl2db.pl
----------
- Add code to explicitly drop the nodelist table index before recreating it.

- Script does not seem to properly handle a file that ends in just blank
lines, instead of a content line or a ^Z character.

- When there are multiple nodelists of the same name being processed, the
script is using just one of them;  but not always the most recent one like
it should. (get_nodelist_filename subroutine)

- Get quoting working properly for entry into the database for fields like
$loc & $name, so do not have to take out characters like single quotes, etc.

- Also need to ensure that LF and/or CR characters at the end of each line do not
make it into the database as they are ending up in the $flags field.

nldbadm.pl
-----------
- Add an explicit create ftndb subroutine;  it's not needed for sqlite databases
  but it can be for others.
- Add options to create or drop the ftnnode index on the nodelist table.
- Add better error checking.

In General
-----------

- Add quiet option, -q, for logging only operation ? 

- Add a test nodelist for use with this?...
