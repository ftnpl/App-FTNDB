To Do:  v1.2   03/04/10


- The issue with periods in table names is not limited to mysql, but is 
a more general issue where it is not a good idea to use them at all.  Redo
the comments in both scripts regarding that, to generalize it.

- SQLite supports transactions;   add the explicit use of such to both
scripts?  Or just use the implicit useage of them?

- Since SQLite uses a file for the database;  add a command line parameter
to the scripts the sets the name & path, but allows for a default name.

- review all usage of subroutine calls, because I think I habitually
used the "&" calling convention, even though I don't think that 
the subroutines have any need for direct access to the parameters that
the script was called with ("@_"), and those parameters are put into
their own variables as neccessary in any cose.  Reference perldoc perlsub.

- Either just use the FTN::Log module instead of the FTN::Utility module,
  or expand the existing subroutine in the scripts to use the same code as
  in the module.

nl2sql.pl
----------
- Script does not seem to handle properly a file that ends in just blank
lines, instead of content line or a ^Z character.

- When there are multiple nodelists of the same name being processed, the
script is using just one of them;  but not always the most recent one like
it should. (getnlfilename subroutine)

- get quoteing working properly for entry into the database for fields like
$loc & $name, so do not have to take out char's like single quotes, etc.

- add option to do the table index creation separately?


nldbadm.pl
-----------

- creating the ftnnode index had been being done as part of creating the
nodelist table.  Create a separate subroutine to do that.  That would
also allow adding being able to recreate the index if requested.

- replace use of TableExists function with using sql code
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS <tablename>;

- add better error checking.

In General
-----------

- add quiet option, -q, for logging only operation ? 

- add a test nodelist for use with this?...

- the source field in the nodelist table is not enough?; add a new table,
nladm (?), that for nodelist files lists the filename with extension.
(& a timestamp?)
